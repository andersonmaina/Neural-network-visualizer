# Neural-network-visualizer - Native Web App
Lost quite a few brain cells building this- not perfect but works. Don't exaggerate parameters. Its not that robust. YOU WILL BREAK IT. Hit CTRL + R if you've reached the point of no return, especially if you messed with the optimizers. Trust me<br><br>Feed foward neural network - it will try to approximate any custom function that takes in two inputs and gives one output. This is addition and subtraction redefinedðŸ˜‚. Go crazy with iT.
